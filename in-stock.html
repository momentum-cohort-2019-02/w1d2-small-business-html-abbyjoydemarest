        <li>
            <b>Wild Hycinth</b>
            <p>
                    This bulbflower natur
                    alizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. 
                    It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadoes or prairies. 
                    Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. 
                    The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. 
                    Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.

        <li>
            <b>Lily of the Valley</b>
            <p> With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- 
            this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. 
            But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, 
            and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. 
            Tolerates shade well. <br><b>** Warning: this plant is poisonous.**</b>

        <li>
            <b>Crown Imperials</b> <br>
               <p>Crown Imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid growth in the spring, 
                    flowering during April/early May and dying down in early summer. Best in raised beds or planeters. 
                    Does not tolerate shade: needs a warm, sunny position where it can be left undisturbed for many years.</p>

            <b>Persian Buttercup</b><br>
            <p>These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and Uruguay and form dense clupms of perennial 
                flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up
                 to half a foot tall with similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, 
                 deeply green foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</p>

                We have a variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs in the fall, 
                6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F.
